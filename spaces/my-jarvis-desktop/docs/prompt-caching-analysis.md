# Prompt Caching Analysis for My Jarvis Desktop

## The Game-Changing Math

### Without Caching
- 20,000 token context (architecture + docs + codebase)
- Cost: ~$1.00 per request (at $0.05/1k tokens)
- $200 budget = 200 conversations
- No optimization possible

### With SDK Prompt Caching
- First request: $1.25 (25% premium to cache)
- Subsequent requests: $0.10 (90% discount)
- Cache lasts 5 minutes, refreshes on each use
- $200 budget = ~1,980 conversations (10x increase!)

## How It Works

1. **Initial Cache Creation**
   - Pay 125% of normal rate
   - Mark stable content: CLAUDE.md, architecture docs, project overview
   - Cache stored for 5 minutes

2. **Cache Reuse**
   - Pay only 10% for cached portions
   - Only new user input charged at full rate
   - Cache auto-refreshes with each use (never expires during active session)

3. **Smart Caching Strategy**
   ```
   CACHED (rarely changes):
   - /spaces/my-jarvis-desktop/docs/architecture.md
   - /spaces/my-jarvis-desktop/docs/project-overview.md
   - CLAUDE.md instructions
   - Core codebase structure
   
   NOT CACHED (changes frequently):
   - User's current question
   - Recent file modifications
   - Active ticket content
   ```

## Real Budget Impact

### Typical My Jarvis Session
- Context size: 20,000 tokens
- Average conversation: 10 exchanges

#### Traditional API
- 10 requests × $1.00 = $10.00 per session
- $200 budget = 20 sessions

#### With Prompt Caching
- First request: $1.25
- 9 subsequent: 9 × $0.10 = $0.90
- Total: $2.15 per session
- $200 budget = 93 sessions (4.6x improvement)

## SDK vs Terminal Caching

### Terminal (Claude Code)
- May have internal caching (undocumented)
- No control over what gets cached
- No visibility into cache hits/misses
- Can't optimize for your specific workflow

### SDK
- Explicit cache control via API
- Mark exactly what to cache
- Monitor cache performance
- Optimize based on usage patterns

## Implementation Priority

### Must Cache (Stable, Large)
1. Architecture documents (5,000+ tokens)
2. CLAUDE.md instructions (2,000+ tokens)
3. Project overview (3,000+ tokens)
4. Core utility functions (10,000+ tokens)

### Don't Cache (Dynamic, Small)
1. User queries (<100 tokens)
2. Git diff output
3. Test results
4. Recent file changes

## Combined Optimizations

### Batch Processing + Caching = 95% Discount
- Batch API: 50% discount (24-hour wait)
- Caching: 90% discount on batch price
- Combined: 95% total discount
- Use case: Background analysis, documentation generation

## ROI Calculation

### SDK Implementation Cost
- 2 days development
- TypeScript/Python integration
- Cache management logic

### Return
- 10x more conversations per dollar
- Faster response times (85% latency reduction)
- Predictable costs
- Production-ready scaling

## Conclusion

**Prompt caching alone justifies the SDK investment**. It transforms the $200 API budget from a limitation into genuine abundance. This isn't about fancy features—it's about making My Jarvis Desktop economically viable for daily professional use.

The SDK's prompt caching is THE killer feature that the terminal can't match.
