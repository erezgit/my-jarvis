# SDK-Exclusive Capabilities Analysis

## Features That TRULY Require Claude Code SDK
*These cannot be achieved with terminal + file watching*

### 1. Real-Time Token Streaming
- **SDK**: WebSocket connections with token-by-token streaming to custom UIs
- **Terminal**: Only outputs complete responses, no intermediate streaming
- **Impact**: Critical for responsive chat interfaces showing Claude "thinking"

### 2. Multiple Concurrent Sessions
- **SDK**: Run multiple Claude instances with different contexts simultaneously
- **Terminal**: Single session limitation (one context at a time)
- **Impact**: Essential for multi-agent architectures or parallel processing

### 3. Embedded Library Integration
- **SDK**: Import Claude as a library directly in your application code
- **Terminal**: Requires spawning separate process with IPC overhead
- **Impact**: Lower latency, better error handling, cleaner architecture

### 4. Automatic Prompt Caching
- **SDK**: Built-in caching reduces API costs by up to 90%
- **Terminal**: No automatic caching optimization
- **Impact**: Massive cost savings at scale

### 5. Fine-Grained Permission Control
- **SDK**: Programmatic control over individual tool permissions
- **Terminal**: All-or-nothing tool access
- **Impact**: Critical for security in production environments

### 6. Enterprise Authentication
- **SDK**: Direct integration with Amazon Bedrock & Google Vertex AI
- **Terminal**: Limited to Anthropic API authentication
- **Impact**: Required for enterprise deployments

### 7. Custom Agent Harnesses
- **SDK**: Build custom agents inheriting Claude Code's core with your logic
- **Terminal**: Fixed Claude Code behavior
- **Impact**: Enables specialized domain-specific agents

### 8. Programmatic Session State
- **SDK**: Persist and restore session state across application restarts
- **Terminal**: Manual session management
- **Impact**: Essential for production reliability

## Features Achievable with Terminal + Workarounds

### ✅ File System Updates
- Terminal writes files → File watcher triggers UI updates
- No SDK advantage here

### ✅ Background Processes
- Terminal can run in tmux/screen sessions
- SDK more elegant but not exclusive

### ✅ Webhook Integration
- Terminal can be triggered by webhook scripts
- SDK provides cleaner integration but not exclusive

### ✅ Cost Tracking
- Can parse Claude Code output for token usage
- SDK provides better APIs but not exclusive

## Recommendation for My Jarvis Desktop

### Essential SDK Features (Worth Implementing)
1. **Token streaming** - For responsive chat experience
2. **Prompt caching** - 90% cost reduction is huge with $200 budget
3. **Multiple sessions** - For parallel agent operations

### Nice-to-Have SDK Features
1. **Embedded library** - Cleaner but not critical initially
2. **Fine permissions** - Important for production, not MVP

### Can Skip (Terminal is Fine)
1. **File system reactivity** - Already working well
2. **Background tasks** - tmux/screen sufficient
3. **Basic automation** - Shell scripts work

## Conclusion

The SDK's killer features are:
- **Real-time streaming** (user experience)
- **Prompt caching** (cost efficiency)
- **Multiple sessions** (scalability)

Everything else can be achieved with clever terminal usage and file watching.
