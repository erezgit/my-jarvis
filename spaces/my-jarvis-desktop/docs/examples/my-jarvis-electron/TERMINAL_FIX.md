# Terminal Implementation Fix

## Issue
The original xterm.js implementation had module loading issues in Electron due to:
- Complex module resolution between CommonJS and ES modules
- Content Security Policy restrictions
- Electron's context isolation preventing direct module access

## Solution
Created a **simple-terminal.html** that implements a basic but fully functional terminal:

### Features
- ✅ Real shell command execution via node-pty
- ✅ Clean input/output display
- ✅ Responds to "Hi Jarvis" commands
- ✅ No complex dependencies or module loading issues
- ✅ Works immediately out of the box

### How It Works
1. **Frontend**: Simple HTML input/output without xterm.js
2. **Backend**: Still uses node-pty for real terminal process
3. **IPC**: Clean communication via contextBridge API
4. **Security**: Maintains context isolation and security best practices

### Usage
The terminal now:
- Executes real shell commands (ls, pwd, cd, etc.)
- Responds to "Hi Jarvis" with AI assistant response
- Shows command history in scrollable output
- Maintains terminal session state

### To Upgrade Later
If you want full xterm.js features later:
1. Use a bundler like Webpack or Vite
2. Bundle xterm.js into a single file
3. Or use Electron Forge for better module handling

For now, the simple terminal provides everything needed for the My Jarvis Desktop proof of concept.
