    title: "Workspace Switching & Onboarding System",
    status: "planned",
    confidence: 7,
    productRequirements: `Enable users to switch between different workspaces (projects) seamlessly and provide a guided onboarding experience for new users.

Key User Stories:
- As a new user, I want a clear onboarding flow that teaches me how to use My Jarvis Desktop
- As a user, I want to switch between different projects/workspaces easily
- As a user, I want each workspace to have its own context and configuration

Success Criteria:
- New users complete onboarding and understand core features
- Users can create and switch between workspaces
- Each workspace maintains separate context and files`,
    architecture: `Workspace Management:
- Workspace registry in user config (~/.my-jarvis/workspaces.json)
- Each workspace has isolated directory structure
- Workspace switcher in UI (dropdown or sidebar)
- Context reset on workspace switch

Onboarding Flow:
- Create dedicated onboarding workspace template
- Interactive tutorial steps stored as MDX files
- Progress tracking using TicketStack components
- Setup wizard for API keys (Claude, OpenAI)

    title: "Enhanced MDX Components for Planning",
    status: "active",
    confidence: 8,
    productRequirements: `Build rich interactive components that make planning, tracking, and visualizing work more intuitive and beautiful.

Key User Stories:
- As a user, I want to see my work timeline visually
- As a user, I want a calendar view of upcoming tasks
- As a user, I want dashboard views that fit on one screen

Components Needed:
- TicketStack ✅ (just built!)
- Calendar - work planning calendar
- Timeline - sequential progress visualization
- StatusDashboard - single-screen project status`,
    architecture: `Component Library Structure:
app/components/FilePreview/mdx/mdx-components/
  ├── TicketStack.tsx ✅
  ├── Calendar.tsx (planned)
  ├── Timeline.tsx (planned)
  └── StatusDashboard.tsx (planned)

Design Principles:
- Theme-aware (light/dark mode support)
- Single-screen fit (no scrolling for dashboards)
- Clean, minimal aesthetic matching app design
- Interactive where beneficial (collapsible sections)

Data Format:
- All components accept JSON data props
- Can be used inline in MDX files
- Support both static and dynamic data`,

    title: "User Message Styling & UI Polish",
    status: "completed",
    confidence: 9,
    productRequirements: `Make the chat interface clean, beautiful, and easy to read with proper visual hierarchy.

Key Changes:
- User messages with green background for visibility
- Consistent font sizing (14px)
- Clean button design with neutral colors
- Proper spacing between UI elements`,
    architecture: `UI Design System:
- Neutral color palette (grays, minimal color accents)
- Green (#059669) for user messages
- Sky blue for links and headings
- Transparent backgrounds where possible
- 14px base font size for consistency

Component Updates:
- ChatPage.tsx - spacing and layout
- UserMessage.tsx - green background
- SettingsButton/HistoryButton - minimal design
- TokenContextBar - increased padding
- ChatInput - font size consistency`,
    implementation: [
      { name: "Update user message styling with green background", done: true },
      { name: "Standardize font sizes across components", done: true },
      { name: "Simplify button designs (remove backgrounds/borders)", done: true },

      { name: "Build and test in production", done: true },
    ],
    nextAction: "Complete - all UI polish implemented in v1.10.0"
  },
]} />

## Next Steps

After testing the TicketStack component (you're looking at it right now!), we'll decide whether to:

1. **Focus on onboarding** - Build the workspace switching and new user experience
2. **Expand MDX components** - Add Calendar and Timeline for better planning
3. **Ship to early users** - Package and distribute to Lilach, Yonatan, Nier, Arielle

The TicketStack component itself is a perfect example of building the tools we need for ourselves first, then using them for users.
